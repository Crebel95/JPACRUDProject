# Overview
The name of this project is 'American Silver Coins'. It is a website that allows the user to create, update, delete, and view information about American silver coins that are stored in the database. Specifically, users can see a coin's type (Mercury dime, Peace Dollar etc.), the year it was minted, the issued mint, approximate market value, silver content, and the weight of the coin. In addition, there is also a video on the homepage where the user can learn the basics of American silver currency.

Upon visiting the site, the user is taken to the homepage. The homepage includes a video about American silver and a current list of the coins in the database. The user has the option of clicking on any coin in the database, which will redirect the user to another page where they can see a description of the selected coin. At the top of each page, there is a navigation bar that contains multiple options, including: 'Home', 'Search Coin ID', 'Add New Coin', 'Delete Coin', 'Learn More'.

Home: redirects the user to the 'American Silver Coins' homepage.

Search Coin ID: Allows the user to search for any coin in the database based off an ID number. If a coin is found, the details of the coin will be listed.

Add New Coin: Allows for the user to add a new silver coin to the database. The user also has the option of providing certain details of the coin.

Delete Coin: Allows the user to delete a coin from the database.
